How did you start?</strong> <p>I've been programming almost as long as I can remember. My parents both program, so they encouraged me as a child. I started with Logo and moved on to GWBasic, then Pascal.  <p><strong></strong><strong>When did you start to realize that you would achieve so much?</strong> <p>I guess it was when I was still in primary school. In my last year of primary school, I came second in the national high school contest. Then at IOI I got gold medals in my last two years. <p>But I'm still surprised to find myself currently at #3 on the TopCoder ranking. I knew I was good, but some of the top guys are really amazing.  <p><strong></strong><strong>What are your hobbies, other than TopCoder?</strong> <p>What, there are other things to do than TopCodering?  <p>OK, seriously, I do some other programming contests, but also read books, watch movies, play table tennis. I'm a serious fan of Monty Python too.  <p><strong></strong><strong>How do you approach an algorithmic SRM event?</strong> <p>A lot of it is about having the right mindset - believing that you can solve the problems and having faith in your solution. At the moment I'm working in the order easy-medium-hard. I usually submit as soon as I can solve all the sample cases, although depending on the problem I might test some corner cases as well.  <p>Something I learned from <a href="http&#58;//www.topcoder.com/tc?module=MemberProfile&amp;cr=10574855&amp;tab=alg">Petr</a> is to then test the problem immediately, rather than hoping there is time to come back and do it later.  <p><strong>How did you go about preparing for the TCO07 Finals?</strong> <p>Initially, I just took part in as many SRMs as I could. When I started, I switched to VIM on Windows, which is the environment I used at the finals. I also worked through old finals in the practice rooms. Finals tend to have tougher problems than SRMs, so it was important to make the mental adjustment.  <p><strong></strong><strong>How have TopCoder events changed your programming?</strong> <p><font color="#0000ff">It's definitely made my coding faster and less error-prone. I don't type any faster, but I've picked up a lot of shortcuts and so I write less code. And the less code you write, the less chance there is of bugs.</font>  <p><font color="#0000ff">I also used to try to fully optimize almost everything</font>, as a result of experience with IOI and similar contests. I now take the approach that I try to write the minimum amount of code to get the job done, even if it's a bit slower to run.  <p><strong></strong><strong>What topics of study would you suggest to a new TopCoder member who wants to excel in algorithmic contests?</strong> <p>You should definitely work through the <a href="http&#58;//www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=tutorials&amp;d2=alg_index">Algorithm tutorials</a> on the TopCoder site - they're all important. I guess <font color="#0000ff">dynamic programming</font> and <font color="#0000ff">graph theory</font> are the two pillars on which most contest problems are based.  <p>But no amount of <font color="#0000ff">book-learning</font> is going to help without experience. The best way to get good at TopCoder is to take part in a lot of matches and, after each match, find out what theory you needed to solve the problems.  <p><strong></strong><strong>What is your proudest moment in TopCoder? How did you feel?</strong> <p>I would say advancing from the final round at the TCCC06 finals. I was really happy about it, and a little bit disbelieving.  <p><strong></strong><strong>You have done exceedingly well in both Algorithm SRMs and Marathon Matches. What's the difference in the approach required by these kinds of competition?</strong> <p>There is an element of planning in both, but to excel in an algorithm match you have to dive in quite quickly and trust your instincts.  <p>In a marathon match it pays to take things slowly and methodically, making notes of different ideas, analyzing things theoretically before implementing them, and testing changes one at a time instead of in a big bunch.  <p><strong></strong><strong>What are your future plans?</strong> <p><font color="#0000ff">At the moment I'm finish up a PhD</font>. After that I'm hoping to find a job in the <font color="#0000ff">computer graphics industry</font>. Hopefully I'll still be able to compete in TopCoder.  <p><strong></strong><strong>They say, “Behind every man’s success, there is a woman”, maybe you could coin a new phrase. “Behind every man’s successful coding, there is a _________”??</strong> <p><font color="#0000ff">Debugger</font>?  <p><strong>What do you think is the main key to your success?</strong> <p>I think its proficiency for algorithms and reasonable consistency. I haven't won many SRMs, and I don't have the highest submission success rate, but I usually get 2 or 3 problems in reasonably quickly and I don't often crash out totally.  <p><strong>A piece of advice to fellow TopCoder members?</strong> <p><font color="#0000ff">Practice, practice, practice. </font> <p>  <p>Source&#58; <a title="http&#58;//www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=features&amp;d2=071907" href="http&#58;//www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=features&amp;d2=071907">http&#58;//www.topcoder.com/tc?module=Static&amp;d1=features&amp;d2=071907</a></div><h3>Comments</h3><div id="bp-E6ABAA9EB5974A6D_1420-comments" class="comments"><div id="comment-E6ABAA9EB5974A6D_1423"><h5 id="comment-E6ABAA9EB5974A6D_1423">p k - 2007/7/20 14&#58;04&#58;52</h5><div>不想做coder～～～ </div></div><div id="comment-E6ABAA9EB5974A6D_1424"><h5 id="comment-E6ABAA9EB5974A6D_1424">islet8 - 2007/7/20 15&#58;25&#58;39</h5>Great!<br />But, behind every man's failure, there are tooooooooooooo many wemen...<br />Just for fun &#58;)<br /></div></div></div></body></html>
